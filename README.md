# Bus Tracking Exercise
## Description
  In this exercise, a marker moves across the different bus stops along a bus route from MIT to Harvard Campus every 1 second.
## How to Run
  Download all files to the same folder on your machine and run index.html on your web browser. When you click on the Show Stops between MIT and Harvard button, the marker will move across all bus stop locations between the 2 campuses
## Future Improvements
  I want to pul real time data to show current locations of buses along this route
## License
  This is an exercise from the MIT Professional Certificate in Coding Course
